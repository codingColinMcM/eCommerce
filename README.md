## Description

A backend for a website where customers can shop for products in an online store. Sequelize is used to store and manipulate the data of the website. Data from the website was stored in 4 tables: category, product, tag, and product-tag. Http requests are used to display, add, update, and delete data with get, post, put, and delete routes respectively. These routes were tested with Insomnia in the demo video below.
